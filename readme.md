Build different machine learning models to predict the attrition of customers using different algorithms

Visualized the features for determining the effective attributes in connection with the ‘Exit’ status using Matplotlib and Seaborn library

Built 5 prediction models with SVM, Ensemble method, Naïve Bayes, Artificial Neural Network, and Logistic Regression algorithms

Performed Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV class to determine the best parameters and values for the models so that the accuracy will be high

Calculated the precision of different models using accuracy score metric
